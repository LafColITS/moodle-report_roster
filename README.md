This is a simple report which displays the user pictures for everyone enrolled in the given course.

Requirements
------------
- Moodle 3.4 (build 2017111300 or later)

Installation
------------
Copy the roster folder into your /report directory and visit your Admin Notification page to complete the installation.

Usage

Reports > Roster within the course.

There are three options when viewing the roster:

- "Learning mode," which turns the display of names on and off
- "Printable" view, which brings up a version of the report suitable for printing.
- A "Groups" filtering option
