=============

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/LafColITS/moodle-report_roster.png)](https://api.travis-ci.org/LafColITS/moodle-report_roster)

This is a simple report which displays the user pictures for everyone enrolled in the given course.

You can install it using git. In the top-level folder of your
Moodle install, type the command:
    git clone git://github.com/LafColITS/moodle-report_roster.git report/roster

Then visit the admin screen to allow the install to complete.

Once the plugin is installed, you can access the functionality by going to
Reports > Roster within the course.

There are three options when viewing the roster:

- "Learning mode," which turns the display of names on and off
- "Printable" view, which brings up a version of the report suitable for printing.
- A "Groups" filtering option
